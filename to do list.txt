-Maybe try implement them in new types of environments or in different action spaces
-Also try combine them
-Start on report and include references!

-improve noise generator maybe?

Presentation:
-compare LunarLanderContinuous for p = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
-test on a new discrete environment
-get a graph showing evaluation performance for cartpole after 500,000 trainsteps with p=0.2
-propose other forms of noise/interference
-add references as footnotes
-as an end-game experiment, combine all the different forms of noise in an intense continous environment
